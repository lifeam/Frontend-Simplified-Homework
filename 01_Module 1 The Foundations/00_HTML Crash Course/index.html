    (1.) In order for this <a> tag to show on the page, there must be something in the tag. If "Discord Server" is not there then you will see the link in the developer tools but you will not see something clickable on the actual page
    
    (2.) To allow a page to open up in a different tab then you have to add [target="_blank"] before closing the first set of brackets.
    
    (3.) You need to have the "https://" or you will not be going anywhere!

    <!-- 
     (1.) "https://" is not needed because it is linking within the same website 
     
     (2.) It seems to work without typing forward slash (/) before the page link but I think that the forward slash triggers the autocomplete.

     (3.) Because <a> is an inline tag that is why the two links are displayed right next to each other

     If I would have typed the forward slash then I would have had to select the full path because I have these multuple folders that is defining the file structure of this whole FES course instead of doing a separate repository for each lesson. Typing "/dashboard" gets me an error message! The following is an example of what I would have had to keep selecting in order to reach the file named "dashboard.html". Also I am wrapping it in a div so that it can be displayed on a new line
     
     NEW INFORMATION: by typing ./ then I would be telling it to look in the same level that I am currently in. Meaning I just added a folder and named it assets and now I want to access something in it, I would need to type ./ so that I could start looking from the level where I am currently at instead of having to go up the whole directory. As of right now, the folder named assets and the two files named dashboard.html and index.html are on the same level

     ../ will allow you to look at a folder that is outside of the folder that you are in
